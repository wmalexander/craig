## Resume Work Prompt

I'm working on a WordPress plugin for FloydFest 2025 countdown. We've completed:
- Phase 1: Core plugin structure (v0.1.0)
- Phase 2: Frontend countdown implementation (v0.2.0)

The plugin displays a countdown timer to July 23, 2025. Check `planning.md` for the development roadmap and `CLAUDE.md` for architecture details.

Next priorities:
1. **Phase 3**: Complete WordPress integration and test theme compatibility
2. **Phase 4**: Build the admin settings page with color pickers and position options
3. **Phase 5**: Add shortcode `[floydfest_countdown]` and widget support

Please create a feature branch for the next phase and follow the same PR workflow we've been using.
